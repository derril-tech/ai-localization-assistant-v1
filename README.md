# AI Localization Assistant (CrewAI + DeepL)

**AI-powered localization playground for product and marketing teams.** Paste source copy once, pick locales and tone, and let a CrewAI of Translator, Context Reviewer, and Proofreader agents turn it into high‑quality, on‑brand translations.

## ✨ What this app does

### 🎯 Core Localization Flow
- **Multi‑locale runs**: Paste source text (e.g. English) and get translations for multiple target locales in a single run.
- **CrewAI agents**:
  - **Translator** – uses DeepL for accurate baseline translations.
  - **Context Reviewer** – adjusts tone, brand voice, and product context.
  - **Proofreader** – polishes grammar, fluency, and microcopy.
- **Per‑locale cards**: Clean, card‑based layout for each locale with copy‑to‑clipboard.

### 🧠 AI Enhancements
- **Real‑time translation preview** – debounced DeepL preview while typing in `/playground`.
- **Baseline vs. refined comparison** – side‑by‑side diff view that highlights what the crew changed.
- **Batch mode** – run line‑by‑line batch translations with progress and results grid.
- **Quality scores** – 0–100 overall and per‑metric (fluency, accuracy, tone match, cultural fit) using `gpt-4.1-mini`.
- **Agent insights timeline** – see what each agent did at each step of the pipeline.
- **Alternatives per locale** – 2–3 alternative translations per locale, selectable per card.
- **Interactive chat** – ask questions like “Why did you choose this German phrasing?” and get context‑aware answers.

### 🌐 Collaboration & Export
- **Shareable links** – one click to copy a public, read‑only URL for a specific job (`/share/{jobId}`).
- **Export** – download translations as JSON, CSV, PO, or XLIFF directly from the browser.
- **Dashboard** – `/dashboard` shows recent jobs from Supabase with locales, tone, and translation snippets.

### 🎨 UX and Design
- **Modern 2025 UI** – video hero, gradients, and micro‑animations, all theme‑safe.
- **Light / dark mode** – full theme support via CSS variables and `ThemeProvider`.
- **Mobile‑first** – responsive layouts for `/`, `/dashboard`, `/playground`, and `/share/[id]`.
- **Accessible** – labeled controls, focus-visible outlines, and keyboard-friendly nav.

## Overview

**Localization Assistant** orchestrates a crew of three specialized AI agents:

- **Translator**: Uses DeepL API to generate accurate baseline translations
- **Context Reviewer**: Adjusts translations for tone, brand voice, and product context
- **Proofreader**: Finalizes translations for grammar, fluency, and microcopy polish

Together, they produce production-ready localized content that maintains brand consistency across multiple languages.

## Features

- 🌍 **Multi-language Translation**: Paste source copy and get localized variants for multiple target locales in one run
- 🎯 **Tone Customization**: Specify tone and high-level guidelines to ensure localized copy stays on-brand

- 📊 **Job History**: Inspect past localization jobs and re-run specific strings when requirements change
- 💾 **Export Ready**: Final translations available as locale-keyed JSON to plug directly into your frontend
- 🔄 **Real-time Status**: Poll job status and view results as they complete
